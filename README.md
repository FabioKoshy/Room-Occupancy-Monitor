# Room-Occupancy-Monitor
This digital system monitors the real-time occupancy of a room using **entrance and exit photocell sensors**. Implemented in **VHDL**, it counts people entering and leaving, tracks the current occupancy, and asserts a `max_capacity` signal when a user-defined threshold is reached.
